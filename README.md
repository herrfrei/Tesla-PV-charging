# Tesla-PV-charging
This documents my solution to charge my Tesla with PV excess. I own a Tesla Model 3, a Huawei PV system with 8.5kW peak and 10kWh battery. The Tesla is plugged into a "dumb" wallbox that can charge with 11kW (3-phase). All charge control is done via the car API, the wallbox is dumb and does just safety stuff.
